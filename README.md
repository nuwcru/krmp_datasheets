# Workspace to scrape information from the rankin data sheets

Goal is to pull and organize information from the yearly field sheets. This will decrease error, hopefully increase efficiency, and will allow error checking to flag inconsistencies within site specific sheets. 
Data to be pulled:
 * lay dates
 * hatch dates
 * band numbers - adult and nestling
 * weights / ages
 * supplement vs control
 
Anything else people can think of for back entry.
